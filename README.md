I have developed a discord autotyping software that logs in automatically when launched and is then able to interact on any discord channel one wishes by typing out phrases randomly of any conversation script the user inserts in the code. The bot can automatically reply to other people in the chat and with different responses depending on words filtered out from other peopleâ€™s replies.
